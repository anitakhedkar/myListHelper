## What is the problem to be solved?
With our hectic lives, chores and grocery shopping etc is pushed to the weekend. We tend to remember tons of things during the week that we need to accomplish during the weekend.
But when the weekend arrives we have no recollection of the things we needed to buy or do. My alexa skill tries to help us with that.

## How will your project solve this problem?
With my project, the user will just say the command to Alexa as in "Alexa, buy X item from Y store" or "add Laundry to my chores list". Alexa will keep storing the information as 
and when she hears the commands in that format. When requested Alexa will reproduce a list of all the items to be bought split up according to the store name.
This will save the users time, energy and brain cells required to type/write down the stuff to be bought.


## What inputs does it need?
A voice command telling Alexa about {which} item to be purchased from {what} store OR what {chore} needs to be done.

## What outputs does it produce?
A consolidated list of items to be purchased sorted based on the different store names and chores. It also sends an email with the list requested.


## What technologies did I use?
Amazon Alexa Amazon echo, Alexa Skill Kit(ASK), Amazon Web Services AWS Lambda, Javascript, Nodejs, DynamoDB, SES. 


## How does this work?
